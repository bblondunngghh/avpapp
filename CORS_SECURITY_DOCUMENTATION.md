# Access Valet Parking - CORS & API Security Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security implementation for the Access Valet Parking management system, including Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) protection, API authentication, and data security measures.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Environment Variable Security

All sensitive credentials are now stored as environment variables:

- `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS`: Gmail SMTP credentials
- `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` and `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`: Push notification keys
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Session encryption key
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string

### 2. Enhanced CORS Protection

#### Allowed Origins
- Development: `localhost:3000`, `localhost:5000`
- Production: `access-valet-parking.replit.app`
- Dynamic Replit domains: Pattern-matched `.replit.dev`, `.replit.app` domains

#### Security Features
- Origin validation with regex patterns
- Method restrictions (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS)
- Header validation
- Credentials support for authenticated requests
- Preflight request handling

### 3. API Authentication & Authorization

#### Authentication Levels

1. **Public Endpoints** (No authentication required):
   - Health checks
   - Static assets
   - PDF templates

2. **Authenticated Endpoints** (Admin or Employee login required):
   - Employee data (read-only)
   - Shift reports
   - Location data
   - Help requests

3. **Admin-Only Endpoints** (Admin authentication required):
   - Employee management (create, update, delete)
   - Financial reports
   - System configuration
   - Sensitive employee data

#### Security Middleware Stack

```typescript
// Global security layers applied to all requests:
1. Enhanced CORS validation
2. Security headers (XSS, clickjacking protection)
3. Rate limiting (150 requests per 15 minutes)
4. User agent validation
5. Suspicious activity detection
```

### 4. Data Protection

#### PII (Personally Identifiable Information) Security
- SSN, driver's license, and DOB are hashed using bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
- Sensitive data sanitization in logs
- Secure transmission only
- Access logging for audit trails

#### Session Security
- PostgreSQL-based session storage
- Secure session cookies
- Automatic session expiration
- CSRF protection via same-site cookies

### 5. Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection

#### Global Rate Limits
- 150 requests per 15-minute window per client
- Automatic client identification via IP + User Agent
- Graceful degradation with retry-after headers

#### Suspicious Activity Detection
Blocks requests with patterns indicating:
- Automated tools (curl, wget, python scripts)
- Web crawlers and bots
- Malicious user agents
- Repeated failed authentication attempts

### 6. Content Security Policy (CSP)

#### Security Headers Applied
```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://apis.google.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; img-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src 'self' https: wss: ws:; frame-src 'none'; object-src 'none';
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=(), usb=()
```

## API Endpoint Security Matrix

| Endpoint Category | Authentication Required | Authorization Level | Rate Limiting | Data Sensitivity |
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Employee Data | ✅ | Admin/Employee | Standard | High (PII) |
| Shift Reports | ✅ | Admin/Employee | Standard | Medium |
| Financial Data | ✅ | Admin Only | Strict | High |
| Help Requests | ✅ | Admin/Employee | Standard | Low |
| Document Upload | ✅ | Admin Only | Strict | Medium |
| PDF Generation | ✅ | Admin Only | Standard | Low |
| Push Notifications | ✅ | Admin/Employee | Standard | Low |

## Security Monitoring

### Audit Logging
All sensitive operations are logged with:
- Client IP address
- User agent string
- Origin domain
- Timestamp
- Authentication status
- Request parameters (sanitized)

### Failed Authentication Tracking
- Automatic blocking after 3 failed attempts
- Progressive delays for repeated failures
- Admin notification for persistent attacks

## Deployment Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] HTTPS enforced in production
- [ ] Database connection encrypted
- [ ] Session secrets rotated
- [ ] VAPID keys generated and secured

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] CORS origins validated
- [ ] SSL certificate verified
- [ ] Security headers tested
- [ ] Rate limiting verified
- [ ] Authentication flows tested

## Emergency Security Procedures

### Security Incident Response
1. **Immediate**: Block suspicious IPs via rate limiting
2. **Short-term**: Rotate session secrets and API keys
3. **Long-term**: Review and update security policies

### Data Breach Protocol
1. Immediately invalidate all active sessions
2. Rotate all encryption keys
3. Audit access logs for compromise scope
4. Notify affected users within 24 hours

## Security Best Practices

### For Administrators
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Regular security audits of employee access
- Monitor failed login attempts

### For Employees
- Keep login credentials secure
- Report suspicious activity immediately
- Use trusted devices for access
- Log out when session complete

## Compliance & Standards

### Data Protection
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- PCI DSS considerations for payment data
- SOX compliance for financial reporting
- HIPAA-aware security practices

### Industry Standards
- OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ISO 27001 security management
- CIS Controls implementation
